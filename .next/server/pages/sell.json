Inside the admin area, you'll find straightforward controls for changing themes, colors, navigation, logos and settings â€” so you can set your site up just how you like it. No technical knowledge required.</p><p>If you're feeling a little more adventurous, there's really no limit to what's possible. With just a little bit of HTML and CSS you can modify or build your very own theme from scratch, or connect to Zapier to explore advanced integrations. Advanced developers can go even further and build entirely custom workflows using the Ghost API.</p><p>This level of customization means that Ghost grows with you. It's easy to get started, but there's always another level of what's possible. So, you won't find yourself outgrowing the app in a few months time and wishing you'd chosen something more powerful!</p><hr><p>For now, you're probably just wondering what to do first.

Everything about your layout and design can be changed, so you're not stuck with yet another clone of a social network profile.</p><p>How far you want to go with customization is completely up to you, there's no right or wrong approach! The majority of people use one of Ghost's built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows. </p><p>The best way to get started is with Ghost's branding settings, where you can set up colors, images and logos to fit with your brand.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/brandsettings.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3456\" height=\"2338\"><figcaption>Ghost Admin â†’ Settings â†’ Branding</figcaption></figure><p>Any Ghost theme that's up to date and compatible with Ghost 4.0 and higher will reflect your branding settings in the preview window, so you can see what your site will look like as you experiment with different options.</p><p>When selecting an accent color, try to choose something which will contrast well with white text. Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements. Vibrant colors with a darker hue tend to work best, as a general rule.</p><h2 id=\"installing-ghost-themes\">Installing Ghost themes</h2><p>By default, new sites are created with Ghost's friendly publication theme, called Casper. Everything in Casper is optimized to work for the most common types of blog, newsletter and publication that people create with Ghost â€” so it's a perfect place to start.</p><p>However, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can pick out a look and feel that suits you best.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/themesettings.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3208\" height=\"1618\"><figcaption>Ghost Admin â†’ Settings â†’ Theme</figcaption></figure><p>Inside Ghost's theme settings you'll find 4 more official themes that can be directly installed and activated. Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.</p><ul><li><strong>Casper</strong> <em>(default)</em> â€” Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters</li><li><strong>Edition</strong> â€” A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors</li><li><strong>Alto</strong> â€” A slick news/magazine style design for creators</li><li><strong>London</strong> â€” A light photography theme with a bold grid</li><li><strong>Ease</strong> â€” A library theme for organizing large content archives</li></ul><p>And if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/themes/\">Ghost Marketplace</a>, where you'll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.</p><h2 id=\"building-something-custom\">Building something custom</h2><p>Finally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.</p><p>Ghost's theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.</p><p>If you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it's like, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/casper/\">browse through the files of the default Casper theme</a>.

Don't let its minimal looks fool you, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to accommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.</p><p>For many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start writing as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would expect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.</p><p>Our main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things that you hope/expect might work: actually work. </p><ul><li>You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best to correctly preserve the formatting. </li><li>Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.</li><li>Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.</li><li>Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top: Ghost will turn it into a link.</li><li>You can also paste (or write!)

Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.</figcaption></figure><p>The goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don't have to <em>think</em> so much about the editor. You won't find any disastrous \"block builders\" here, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but identical alignment options. That's not what Ghost is about.</p><p>What you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media into your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.</p><h2 id=\"using-cards\">Using cards</h2><p>You can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the <code>+</code> button, which appears on new lines, or by typing <code>/</code> on a new line to trigger the card menu. Many of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow you to create rich links with embedded structured data:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Open Subscription Platforms</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">A shared movement for independent subscription data.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/favicon.png\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Open Subscription Platforms</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/osp-card.png\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><p>or embed cards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience, from external services:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmH3XMlms8E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>But, dig a little deeper, and you'll also find more advanced cards, like one that only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions) and a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and galleries.</p><blockquote>Once you Â start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of the story changes. Suddenly, you're working in a new format.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-xSMqGH7gi6o-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\"></figure><p>As it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really well.

If you've ever used an email client with a concept of <em>saved replies</em> then this will be immediately intuitive.</p><p>To create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the <code>/</code> command.</p><p>This works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/createsnippet.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2282\" height=\"1272\"></figure><p>You can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.</p><p>Once you get a few useful snippets set up, it's difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.</p><hr><h2 id=\"publishing-and-newsletters-the-easy-way\">Publishing and newsletters the easy way</h2><p>When you're ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members. Just hit the <em>Preview</em> link and you'll get a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and Social.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/preview.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3166\" height=\"2224\"></figure><p>You can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in your email client, and then hit the <em>Publish</em> button to decide who to deliver it to.</p><p>Ghost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has settings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography.
